Basic instructions 

hwota7-8_update-auto-.zip is to be installed with twrp.

The install will check the version of android you are starting on and select correct folder to look at for the update files.

*****The script will determine the media used (either sdcard or usb otg) based on the folders it finds. (/sdcard/*) or (/usbotg/*) 
It checks last for the usbotg, so if you have the files on sdcard from previous install and this time use usb, 
you will not need to clear the sdcard.*******Not working with USB***

You need to add a folder to put your update files in it.

If you are on android 7 you need to have folder name = HWOTA7
If you are on android 8 you need to have folder name = HWOTA8

Needs to be three update files. (2 if downgrade)
The file names should work the way they are downloaded from Hauwei
update.zip
update_**_public.zip
update_**hw_**.zip

The install script will handle any renaming if needed, as long as this basic format holds true.

Included in this zip package are two folders (HWOAT7 , HWOAT8) In these folder are the no-check recovery images needed for this process. 
And there are batch files to automate installing twrp, if you do not already have twrp installed.
Copy the two folders and the hwota7-8_update-auto-.zip to your sdcard. 
Put your update files into the folder that matches your current build. ( HWOTA7= emui5/ android 7 )  ( HWOTA8= emui8 / android 8 ). 
You can put them into both if you want to, because when the install is done the files are cleared form the folder, by stock update process.

There are two (2) prompts for you to press volume button to confirm the install. So it does not have to continue 
if you see something wrong in the displayed messages.
